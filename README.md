# dynamic-translation-app

A Next.js application featuring multiple dynamic routes: 1) A route (/translation/5) for loading posts by a specific ID (5) from a database, displaying them accordingly. 2) A general route (/translation) utilizing the same component but with an empty list of posts. Additionally, the application includes a sidebar that initially fetches all users. Selecting a user from this sidebar redirects to the dynamic route (/translation/:id), tailored to the selected user's ID. The application should be structured to support these functionalities in a user-friendly and efficient manner, incorporating best practices for dynamic routing and data fetching in Next.js.
